=> some printers have issues with that much cards in the manual paper tray, edit this file for this problem

=> we also suggest to test it first manually, some printers turn the card, some turn them twice, after that the file for the backside
   of the card opens, in that case you have to choose $(cat ./print.txt|wc -l) copies manually after you have
   put the cards the other direction into the printer

=> after pressing enter, dont touch your computer until the cards are all printed
